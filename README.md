GRACE_Matlab_Toolbox
GRACE Matlab Toolbox (GRAMAT) contains a set of open-source functions to process GRACE level-2 spherical harmonic coefficient products. Data processing functions in the GMT contain: (1) destriping of SH coefficients to remove “north-to-south” stripes and Gaussian smoothing, (2) spherical harmonic analysis and synthesis, (3) analyzing and reducing leakage effect in GRACE-derived mass variations, (4) analyzing regional mass variations in spatial and temporal domains. Matlab GUIs are presented to facilitate the use of functions in the GRAMAT.

The work has been published in Earth Science Informatics. Please cite this paper if you use this toolbox https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-018-0368-0
